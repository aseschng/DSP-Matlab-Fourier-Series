This code base is Matlab to display

a) the various periodic waveform in time (DIY = a periodic waveform,
SAW, Triangle, and Square)

b) the Fourier Series (magnitude and phase) of the waveforms.

c) The individual sinusoids that adds up to the actual signal.



There is also a python version of the same code:
main_PlotSignalAndFS_vpython_v1
